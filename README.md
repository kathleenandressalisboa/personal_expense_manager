💡 Why I Built This

I developed this project to practice modular programming and improve my ability to structure real-world CLI applications.

It represents my progression from simple scripts to organized, maintainable Python projects.

📈 Future Improvements

Save data using JSON persistence

Implement edit/delete functionality

Refactor to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Add automated unit tests

Convert into a distributable Python package
